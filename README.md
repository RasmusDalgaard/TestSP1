## 2 Two katas
**Complete the following two katas using TDD.**
### 2.1 FAHRENHEIT-TO-CELCIUS CONVERTER
**Use TDD to create a fahrenheit-to-celcius converter.**  
[See code implementation](https://github.com/Cph-ta181/Testing_StudyPoint/blob/main/TestSP1/Converter.cs) method 'convertToFahrenheit'  
[See tests](https://github.com/Cph-ta181/Testing_StudyPoint/blob/main/Tests/ConverterTest.cs) metod 'convertToFahrenheitTest'  
**Use TDD to extend it to a celcius-to-fahrenheit converter**  
[See code implementation](https://github.com/Cph-ta181/Testing_StudyPoint/blob/main/TestSP1/Converter.cs) method 'convertToCelcius'  
[See tests](https://github.com/Cph-ta181/Testing_StudyPoint/blob/main/Tests/ConverterTest.cs) metod 'convertToCelciusTest'  

### 2.2 ROMAN NUMERAL KATA
**Implement an “Arabic numeral to roman numeral” converter using TDD. Follow the standard form of roman numerals.**  
[See code implementation](https://github.com/Cph-ta181/Testing_StudyPoint/blob/main/TestSP1/Converter.cs) method 'convertToRomanNumeral'  
[See tests](https://github.com/Cph-ta181/Testing_StudyPoint/blob/main/Tests/ConverterTest.cs) metod 'convertToRomanNumeralTest'

## 3 Give your thought on TDD
**What was positive and good about using TDD?**

**What was annoying or difficult?**

**What surprised you?**

**Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn’t otherwise have thought of?**
