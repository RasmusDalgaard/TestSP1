# Assignment 1

## Task 1 Reflections
### 1.1 Shooting
**A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible reasons for the man not dying.**
1. Bullet misses man
2. Bullet is stopped before injuring man
3. Bullet wound is non-vital
4. Vital bullet wound is immediately treated

### 1.2 Alien
**An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-bystep instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise)**
1. Pick up toothpaste with left hand.
2. Point end-cap facing you.
3. Turn end-cap anti-clockwise until loose with right hand.
4. Place end-cap somewhere near.
5. Pick up toothbrush so that the brush side is on the left facing you.
6. Bring end of toothpaste and brush of toothbrush togehter.
7. Squeeze toothpaste until half the size of the brush is covered by the toothpaste.
8. While holding the toothbrush in right hand using pinky, ring, and middlefinger. Pick up end-cap.
9. Screw end-cap clock-wise onto the end of the toothpaste.
10. Place toothepaste back where found.
11. Open mouth.
12. Place toothbrush onto backside of uppper-teeth.
13. Move toothbrush to the right most tooth.
14. Move toothbrush from side to side moving slowly more and more towards the left side until you cant go any further.
15. Repeat for biting-side and front side of upper teeth.
16. Repeat step 12-15 on lower teeth.
17. Remove toothbrush from mouth.
18. Spit out toothpaste.
19. Under a faucet rinse brush of toothbrush for any remaining toothpaste.
20. Place toothbrush back where found.


## 2 Two katas
**Complete the following two katas using TDD.**
### 2.1 FAHRENHEIT-TO-CELCIUS CONVERTER
**Use TDD to create a fahrenheit-to-celcius converter.**  
[See code implementation](https://github.com/RasmusDalgaard/TestSP1/blob/main/TestSP1/Converter.cs) method 'convertToFahrenheit'  
[See tests](https://github.com/RasmusDalgaard/TestSP1/blob/main/Tests/ConverterTest.cs) metod 'convertToFahrenheitTest'  
**Use TDD to extend it to a celcius-to-fahrenheit converter**  
[See code implementation](https://github.com/RasmusDalgaard/TestSP1/blob/main/TestSP1/Converter.cs) method 'convertToCelcius'  
[See tests](https://github.com/RasmusDalgaard/TestSP1/blob/main/Tests/ConverterTest.cs) metod 'convertToCelciusTest'  

### 2.2 ROMAN NUMERAL KATA
**Implement an “Arabic numeral to roman numeral” converter using TDD. Follow the standard form of roman numerals.**  
[See code implementation](https://github.com/RasmusDalgaard/TestSP1/blob/main/TestSP1/Converter.cs) method 'convertToRomanNumeral'  
[See tests](https://github.com/RasmusDalgaard/TestSP1/blob/main/Tests/ConverterTest.cs) metod 'convertToRomanNumeralTest'

## 3 Give your thought on TDD
**What was positive and good about using TDD?**  
It was positive knowing that the test defined what the method had to accomplish for the test to pass. Also writing the test as the first thing reassures that we don't forget writing tests.
It also makes it so the codebase is well tested and reliable and it does reduce the chances of bugs and helps keeping a clean maintainable code.

**What was annoying or difficult?**  
At the same time it can be a little tedious having to write a new test each time you want to make a new method. In a sense TDD is a trade-off. It may take up a little more of your time initially but on the other hand it may save you some time later.

**What surprised you?**  
There were no significant surprises. But TDD could have been a tool to improve the code design. The reason why is because it makes us developers think about the structure of the code, which might result in a nice structure and a good solution.

**Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn’t otherwise have thought of?**  
Not in this case because it was a relatively simple execise, but in a more complex program its benefits would have been even more clear.
